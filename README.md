# A Customized version of Bootstrap 3

The current version of PageStudio is built around Bootstrap 3. Designers need a more modern and up to date version of Bootstrap. To support this requirement and to maintain existing PageStudio functionality, this source code incorporates latest styles from Bootstrap 4 in the Bootstrap 3 scss. 

## How to use? 

Grab the compiled `bootstrap-custom.css` file and add it to your project. This is a full featured copy of Bootstrap 3, therefore adding the library separately is not needed. Only the `css` is provided in this repo, add `bootstrap.min.js` as normal.
